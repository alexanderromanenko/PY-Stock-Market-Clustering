    "Which companies experienced the maximum and minimum daily returns?\n",
    "What were the reasons event in point 1 occurred?\n",
    "Which companies performed overall best and worst over the year?\n",
    "Which companies exhibited most and least volatility based on the standard deviation of their returns over the year \n",
    "In order to calculate each company's stock daily return, the calculation would start at day 2 or 5 January 2015 because in that way there would be baseline price to compare with (day 1 or 2 January 2015). From day 2 onwards, the percentage change could be calculated as follows:\n",

    "The biggest daily growth of the year occured on 27/08/2015 for a company called Freeport-McMoran Cp & Gld (NYSE: FCX). The share price has increased from 7.8894 (eod 26/08/2015) to 10.1506 (eod 27/08/2015), a total increase of 28.66%. The sharp increase has resulted from announcement by the company to further cut the costs in response to market conditions. The company predicted that the total capital expenditure will decrease by $700 million.(Freeport-McMoRan Inc., 2016) In addition to the cost cutting, it has been announced on 27/08/2015 that influential investor Carl Icahn has bought a large stake in the company, which indicated a belief by the investor that the company's performance will improve. (Miller & Benoit, 2015) Combination of these two factors had a strong impact on market sentiment towards the company and resulted in large shift of the share price on the day."

    "The biggest daily fall of the year occurred on 16/10/2015 for a company called Quanta Services Inc. (NYSE: PWR). The share price has plummeted from 26.21 (eod 15/10/2015) to 18.74 (eod 16/10/2015), total decrease of 28.5%. The sharp fall has resulted from the company's announcement of its preliminary third quarter results. In the announcement the company lowered its full year revenue forecast by $200 million. This has been a result of a wider trend of reduction in operating margins for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, which in turn impacted by difficult macro-economic environment.(Quanta Services, 2015) It was interesting to note that the company's shares are currently (as of 12/10/2016) trading at 27.65. It shows that the investors' appetite for the shares have gone to above the pre-fall levels."

    "Amazon:          'Alphabet Inc Class A', 0.58391    \n",
    "\n",
    "Highest correlation of Amazon is to Alphabet Inc(partner company of Google). This is not surprising as both companies are leaders in technological sector with a focus on innovative solutions and products aimed at mass market. Therefore prices of these two companies are likely to be affected by the same factors affecting tech companies (i.e. drop/surge in demand, advancements in technology innovation, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft:       'Procter & Gamble', 0.60311\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft shares are highly correlated to Procter & Gamble. This is somewhat a surprising result as the companies' main business in different industries. One reason for a correlation could be the fact that two companies collaborate together and P&G uses tools produced by Microsoft to make its operations more efficient.(Doctolero, 2014) However more likelier reason for the correlation is likely to be explained by the fact that both companies are giants in its own industries with a large amount of customers worldwide. Which in turn means that they are similarly exposed to macroeconomic trends (i.e. unemployment figures, economy growth, Foreign Exchange movements, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Facebook:       'Fiserv Inc', 0.61776  \n",
    "\n",
    "Facebook's highest correlation for 2015 is with Fiserv, which is an american provider of financial services technology. Both companies are in Technological services sector and therefore it is not surprising that their share prices have moved similarly throughout the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Apple:          'Illinois Tool Works', 0.60096\n",
    "\n",
    "Apple's highly correlated company in 2015 was Illinois Tool Works, which a company that specialises in industrial manufacturing. The industry and company's specialisation is different to Apple's and therefore it is difficult to explain the high correlation between the two. The conducted research has largely not found any explanation for this correlation. There is a suggestion that the stocks correlated because one of the areas Illinois Tool Works specialise in is Test & Measurement and Electronics, which is somewhat in the similar area Apple operates.(Chemi & Wells, 2015) However this is cannot be the reason for high correlation therefore this is perhaps an example where relying simply on data could be misleading.\n",

    "Alphabet Inc.*:    'Alphabet Inc Class C', 0.98933 \n",
    "*Alphabet Inc. is a parent company of Google, which was formed on October 2, 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alphabet's (GOOGL) highest correlated company is unsurprisingly is the company's shares C (GOOGLE- Alphabet Inc Class C). The shares are impacted by the same factors almost perfectly and therefore are performing with a correlation, which is very close to 1."
